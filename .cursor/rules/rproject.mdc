# R Package Development Rules

## Pipe Operator
- **Always use `|>` (native pipe) instead of `%>%` (magrittr pipe)**

## Roxygen Documentation
- **Use Roxygen2 for all function documentation**
- **Always include `@importFrom` directives** for functions imported from other packages
- **Do NOT include `@examples` sections** in Roxygen comments
- Standard format: `@title`, `@description`, `@param`, `@return`, `@importFrom package function`
- `@export` is only used for functions that are intended to be used by the user. Internal functions should not be exported and must start with a dot.

## Package Preferences
- **Prefer tidyverse functions over base R** when possible
- Use `dplyr`, `readr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, `purrr` instead of base R equivalents
- Use base R when it's more appropriate or when tidyverse adds unnecessary dependencies


## Code Style
- Use **camelCase**: function and variable names start with lowercase, package names start with uppercase
- Function names are verbs, variable names are nouns (e.g., `fitModel`, `population`)
- Use `<-` for assignment, not `=`
- Place spaces around infix operators (`=`, `+`, `-`, `<-`, etc.) and after commas
- Always use curly braces `{}` for if-then-else, even single statements
- Use named arguments when calling functions with more than one argument
- Pipes (`|>`) should be at the end of the line
- Limit lines to 100 characters
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*; use `#` with a space
